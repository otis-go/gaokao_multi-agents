  "choice_prompt": "[Task Role]\nYou are an assistant to a Gaokao Chinese language item writer. Based on the given \"fused prompt\" and \"passage\", generate 1 Gaokao-style reading comprehension single-choice question with four options.\n\n[Multi-Dimension Fusion Protocol (Internal execution only, do not reveal in output)]\n1) The fused_prompt typically consists of multiple \"dimension blocks/constraint blocks\". Treat each block as a \"parallel and mandatory constraint package\". Do not selectively ignore any block.\n2) Before generation, create an internal coverage checklist: Extract the hard requirements from each block's \"dimension objective/implementation guidelines/acceptance criteria/conflict resolution (if provided)\".\n3) Multi-dimension allocation within a single item (ensure each dimension has a verifiable anchor):\n   - Stem carries: Main task action + evaluation object/context constraints (ensures \"what to ask\" covers dimension objectives).\n   - Correct option carries: Key conclusion + necessary qualifiers (ensures \"what to answer\" covers acceptance criteria).\n   - Distractors carry: Boundary conditions/qualifiers/typical deviation patterns (ensures \"how to err\" covers conflict points).\n   - Analysis carries: Evidence mapping + match/mismatch explanations (ensures \"why correct/incorrect\" forms an evidence closure).\n4) Conflict resolution (minimize dimension loss):\n   - Prioritize more specific, actionable statements in fused_prompt; use abstract statements as supplementary constraints in the analysis.\n   - If a dimension requires \"expressive output\" but the current format is multiple-choice: Convert to \"comparing which option is more accurate/consistent with objects and constraints\", and explain the rationale in the analysis.\n   - If two dimensions both require high-intensity main tasks: Merge into a higher-level unified question (e.g., \"Judge whether X holds under the given context constraints\"), and address different dimensions' evidence and qualifiers separately in the analysis.\n5) Pre-output self-check: Verify each dimension against its acceptance criteria. If any criterion is not explicitly addressed in stem/options/analysis, revise until all are satisfied.\n\n[Fused Prompt (The Only Superior Constraint)]\n{fused_prompt}\n\nMandatory Requirements:\n1. Treat fused_prompt as the only superior constraint. If conflicts exist with this prompt, follow fused_prompt.\n2. Do not introduce new \"ability frameworks/error-setting frameworks/item templates\". Do not use labels like \"XX dimension/XX type error\" in output.\n\n[Passage (Item Basis)]\n{material}\n\n[Evidence Closure Rules]\n1) Item design, distractor creation, and analysis must primarily rely on the passage. Do not use external knowledge as judgment criteria.\n2) Paraphrasing and information compression are allowed, but do not alter the original meaning or add/remove key conditions.\n3) Each option's judgment must be traceable: Passage evidence -> Difference explanation -> Correct/incorrect conclusion.\n\n[Item Generation Task (Generate only 1 item Q1)]\nI. Item and Basis\n1. Format: Generate only 1 single-choice question with four options (Q1).\n2. Stem wording should conform to Gaokao style and reading task requirements. Follow fused_prompt for specific question phrasing.\n\nII. Option Requirements\n1. Correct option: Must have sufficient support from the passage and context. Paraphrasing/compression allowed, but no meaning alteration or key condition changes.\n2. Distractors: Must be highly related to the passage, preferably close to original wording or paraphrased.\n   - Deviation methods follow fused_prompt. If not specified, create non-equivalence through subtle changes in scope/degree/condition/causation/object/sequence/attitude.\n3. Prohibited:\n   - Obvious factual errors or information unrelated to the passage;\n   - Creating distractors through word games or semantic ambiguity;\n   - Using unsupported external knowledge as evidence.\n\nIII. Analysis Requirements\n1. All judgments must be based solely on the passage, not external knowledge.\n2. Each option's analysis must cite the relevant passage section and explain \"match/mismatch points\":\n   - Use natural language to describe \"what was added/removed/replaced with non-equivalent expression/changed relationship or condition\";\n   - Do not use labels like \"dimension/type/error terminology\".\n3. Analysis must show coverage: If fused_prompt contains multi-dimension requirements, the overall and four option analyses must reflect each dimension's constraint implementation (in task action, object specification, condition boundaries, or evidence chain differences).\n\n[Output Format Requirements (Must strictly follow)]\n1. Final output must be a valid JSON object containing only specified fields, no extra fields or comments.\n2. Strictly follow this structure (field names and hierarchy must match):\n\n{{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {{\n      \"id\": \"Q1\",\n      \"stem\": \"...question stem...\",\n      \"options\": {{\n        \"A\": \"...option A...\",\n        \"B\": \"...option B...\",\n        \"C\": \"...option C...\",\n        \"D\": \"...option D...\"\n      }},\n      \"correct_option\": \"C\",\n      \"analysis\": {{\n        \"overall\": \"...describe the item's assessment intent in natural language (no dimension/type/error terminology)...\",\n        \"A\": {{ \"is_correct\": false, \"reason\": \"...cite passage evidence and mismatch points...\" }},\n        \"B\": {{ \"is_correct\": false, \"reason\": \"...cite passage evidence and mismatch points...\" }},\n        \"C\": {{ \"is_correct\": true,  \"reason\": \"...cite passage evidence and match points...\" }},\n        \"D\": {{ \"is_correct\": false, \"reason\": \"...cite passage evidence and mismatch points...\" }}\n      }}\n    }}\n  ]\n}}\n\n[Strict Format Constraints - Must Follow]\n- Do NOT output <think>, <analysis>, <reasoning> or any XML/HTML style tags\n- Do NOT output explanatory text or markdown/code fences before or after JSON\n- Your response must start with {{ and end with }}, containing only valid JSON\n- If unable to generate a complete item for any reason, output minimal valid JSON: {{\"questions\": []}}",
  "essay_prompt": "[Task Role]\nYou are an assistant to a Gaokao Chinese language item writer. Based on the given \"fused prompt\" and \"passage\", generate 1 Gaokao-style reading comprehension short-answer question.\n\n[Multi-Dimension Fusion Protocol (Internal execution only, do not reveal in output)]\n1) The fused_prompt typically consists of multiple \"dimension blocks/constraint blocks\".

Treat fused_prompt as the only superior constraint. If conflicts exist with this prompt, follow fused_prompt.\n2. Do not introduce new \"ability frameworks/item templates\". Do not use labels like \"XX dimension\" in output.\n\n[Passage (Item Basis)]\n{material}\n\n[Evidence Closure Rules]\n1) Stem, answer points, and explanation must primarily rely on the passage. Do not use external knowledge as judgment criteria.\n2) Paraphrasing and information compression are allowed, but do not alter the original meaning or add/remove key conditions.\n3) Each point must be traceable: Passage evidence -> Inference/summary explanation -> Scoring conclusion (point is valid).\n\n[Item Generation Task (Generate only 1 item)]\n1. Format: Generate only 1 short-answer question.\n2. Stem wording style and task requirements follow fused_prompt.\n3. answer_points must provide multiple points:\n   - point: Summarize in your own words (avoid copying original sentences);\n   - score: Positive integer;\n   - evidence_reference: Description of the passage section supporting this point (can be empty list, but recommended to fill).\n4. explanation must show coverage: If fused_prompt contains multi-dimension requirements, the explanation and answer points must reflect each dimension's constraint implementation (in task action, object specification, condition boundaries, or evidence chain correspondence).\n\n[Critical Constraint - No Sub-questions]\n1. **PROHIBITED**: Splitting the item into multiple sub-questions (e.g., \"(1)...(2)...\" or \"First question...Second question...\")\n2. **PROHIBITED**: Using phrases like \"summarize the following two/three points\", \"explain separately\", \"please answer the following questions\" that imply multiple questions\n3. The stem must be **one complete, unified question**. Answer points are multi-angle responses to this single question, not answers to multiple independent questions\n4. Correct examples:\n   - \"Based on the passage, analyze the reasons why the author is optimistic about the future development of Chinese architecture.\" (One question, multi-angle response)\n   - \"What unique values does the author believe traditional Chinese architecture possesses? Please summarize.\" (One question, bullet-point response)\n5. Incorrect examples (ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED):\n   - \"Based on the passage, summarize: (1) Problems in Chinese architecture since modern times; (2) Favorable conditions identified by the author.\"\n   - \"First, explain the reasons for XX; Second, analyze the impact of XX.\"\n   - \"Please answer the following questions from perspectives A and B:...\"\n6.
