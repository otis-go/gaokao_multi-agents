    "prompt_eval": "The core focus of this dimension assessment is: whether the question truly takes comparative reading and dialectical judgment of multiple texts or multiple viewpoints as the main task, having examinees compare similarities and differences among multiple argumentative or expository materials, analyze the relationship between viewpoints and materials, and make evidence-based comprehensive evaluations that are not one-sided, rather than merely staying at single-text information extraction or unilateral stance statements.\n\nPlease evaluate the alignment between the given question and the \"Comparative Reading and Dialectical Judgment\" dimension from the following aspects:\n\n1. Orientation Alignment\nExamine whether the core requirements of the question stem and answer key points focus on \"comparing multiple materials or multiple viewpoints,\" \"analyzing the supporting and constraining relationships between viewpoints and materials,\" and \"making evidence-based dialectical judgments and comprehensive evaluations,\" rather than merely requiring restatement of single-text content, concept explanation, or general appreciation. If comparison and dialectical judgment are only minor supplementary questions rather than the focus of the question set, alignment is relatively low.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment\nCheck whether materials are argumentative or expository texts (including comprehensive materials with charts and data), whether there are two or more materials, viewpoints, or cases around the same topic, object, or phenomenon; whether these materials have comparability with clear contrast dimensions in content, stance, emotional tendency, material selection, applicable conditions, etc. If materials are mainly slogan-style or promotional language lacking specific facts and evidence, or simply piling up unrelated fragments, this is not conducive to effective assessment of this dimension.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment\nConfirm whether question types are limited to single-choice questions and short-answer questions, with task format being reading comprehension and written expression; whether questions require examinees to compare, synthesize, and judge within or between texts, rather than designing tasks as speeches, debates, planning, or other oral communication activities, or evolving into pure writing tasks or practical writing template tasks that do not align with this dimension.\n\n4. Ability Chain and Subject Literacy Alignment\nAnalyze whether the question reflects the ability chain of \"obtaining and summarizing multi-text information → comparing similarities and differences → analyzing viewpoint-material relationships → making dialectical judgments,\" whether examinees are required to recognize the reasonableness and limitations of different viewpoints and make comprehensive judgments under certain premises or conditions. If the question mainly assesses common sense judgment, background knowledge memory, or genre identification with almost no involvement of multi-text comparison and dialectical analysis, alignment is low.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree\nIf the question involves argumentation methods, argumentation structure, data use, example methods, expression strategies, and other Chinese language knowledge points, these should primarily serve the tasks of comparison and dialectical judgment, such as explaining differences in material organization and use, argumentation focus between two materials, rather than treating knowledge points as isolated memorization or single skill assessment.\n\n6. Task Level and Comprehensiveness Alignment\nWhether the assessment task has certain comprehensiveness and thinking depth: beyond comparison, whether examinees are also required to form conclusions, propose evaluations or suggestions, and reflect clear argumentation structure and standardized expression in answers; whether it merely stays at the elementary level of listing similarities or differences without further value judgment and conditional awareness. Questions that can guide examinees to weigh pros and cons in real or simulated contexts and analyze applicable conditions typically have higher alignment.\n\n7. Negative Signal Check\nPay special attention to the following situations: materials only provide slogan-style or promotional sentences lacking specific information or factual evidence yet require comparison or judgment; material sets lack comparable dimensions and are mechanically pieced together; questions completely depart from text, having students judge \"who is right or wrong\" based on personal experience or vaguely discuss implications and insights; mainly relying on stance statements or emotional judgments without seeking evidence from texts; question design as interactive or oral tasks. Once these situations occur, alignment evaluation for this dimension should be significantly lowered.\n\nPlease synthesize the above points to determine the alignment between the question and the \"Comparative Reading and Dialectical Judgment\" dimension, using levels such as \"Highly Aligned / Basically Aligned / Partially Related / Significantly Deviated,\" and summarize the main reasons in 2-4 sentences, citing key information from question stems, materials, and reference answers as evidence."

    "dimension_name": "Chinese Language Ability Requirements – Multi-Material Integration",
    "prompt_eval": "The core focus of this dimension assessment is: whether the question truly centers on \"Multi-Material Integration\" as a key Chinese language ability, organizing information screening, comparison, and integration tasks among two or more argumentative or expository materials (including combinations of text with charts, data, and structural diagrams), rather than merely staying at single-material understanding or general value judgment.\n\nAssessment points can be examined from the following aspects:\n\n1. Orientation Alignment\nExamine question stems and reference answers to determine whether the main requirement is: extracting key information related to a certain question from multiple or various media materials, comparing content or viewpoint similarities and differences, or integrating scattered information into conclusions, evidence, features, solutions, etc. according to question requirements; if questions can be answered based on single material only, or mainly assess a certain value stance without reflecting connections and integration among multiple materials, alignment with this dimension is low.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment\nMaterials should be multiple argumentative or expository texts around the same topic or phenomenon, or combination materials of text with charts, data, and structural diagrams, with internal relevance in content, viewpoint, or function among materials. If materials are just loosely assembled platters with almost no connection, or belong to narrative literary work fragments difficult to support multi-material information integration, alignment evaluation should be lowered.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment\nQuestions should adopt single-choice and short-answer question formats, with tasks oriented toward reading comprehension and written expression. Questions typically contain prompts like \"according to materials one, two (or A, B, C),\" \"synthesizing relevant materials,\" \"summarize and compare respectively,\" with answers needing to cover multiple material information. If speeches, debates, planning, or other oral or interactive tasks appear, or requiring writing complete essays, this does not conform to the question type scope of this dimension.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment\nKey assessment aspects should reflect: defining material scope → extracting key information → comparing and categorizing → integrated expression, rather than purely assessing background common sense, attitude statements, or mechanical memorization. Should check whether questions and reference answers reflect ability chains of information screening, structure organization, logical integration, and comparative evaluation, rather than only requiring copying original sentences or circling words.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree\nEven if questions involve genre, argumentation methods, chart reading, concept definition, and other Chinese language knowledge, these should serve multi-material integration, such as using argumentation methods to organize stance differences among different materials, using chart data to support conclusions in text materials. If knowledge point assessment is isolated with no substantial connection to multi-material information integration, alignment is limited.\n\n6. Task Level and \"Four-Wing\" Alignment\nMulti-material integration questions generally have certain comprehensiveness and applied nature, requiring examinees to mobilize information from multiple materials in new contexts to explain problems, compare viewpoints, or propose solutions, not merely low-level recognition and reproduction. When evaluating, pay attention to whether tasks have appropriate cognitive load and level progression, such as from information identification to information integration to simple evaluation, without excessively pursuing technique or memorization.\n\n7. Negative Signals\nOnce the following situations appear, alignment evaluation for this dimension should be significantly lowered: multiple materials lack internal connection and are merely numerical accumulation; questions only ask about individual words, phrases, or isolated knowledge points unrelated to integration tasks; false and forced contexts seriously divorced from student experience; answers can mainly be made based on personal common sense or subjective imagination with weak connection to material evidence; or question design as interactive, oral, or writing tasks rather than reading comprehension and short-answer.\n\nAfter synthesizing the above points, please make a judgment on the alignment of the given question on this dimension, dividing into \"Highly Aligned,\" \"Basically Aligned,\" \"Partially Related,\" and \"Significantly Deviated\" levels, and briefly explain reasons in 2-4 sentences, preferably citing key information from question stems, material usage scope, and reference answers that can reflect multi-material information screening, comparison, and integration requirements."

    "dimension_name": "Chinese Language Ability Requirements – Complex Sentence Meaning Inference",
    "prompt_eval": "The core focus of this dimension assessment is: whether the question truly centers on long, complex sentences or key sentences in argumentative/expository texts, assessing examinees' ability to clarify sentence structure and information hierarchy in specific contexts, accurately infer sentence meaning and logical relationships, and appreciate implied meaning and hidden stance, rather than general content summarization or isolated grammatical knowledge analysis.\n\nWhen evaluating, alignment can be judged from the following aspects:\n\n1. Orientation Alignment: Check whether the main questions and reference answers of the question focus on understanding and inferring the basic content, logical relationships, and attitude tendencies of one or several complex/key sentences, such as main information, limiting conditions, cause and effect, transition and progression, comparison, pronoun reference, negation scope, implicit evaluation, etc. If questions mainly ask to summarize the full text theme, analyze author viewpoints, or determine argumentation methods, with sentence-level meaning inference only mentioned in passing, alignment with this dimension is low.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Question materials should be argumentative or expository texts, with questions typically indicating certain underlined, marked, or clearly positioned sentences (or sentence groups) in the question stem, where these sentences carry key information or viewpoint attitudes in the original text and have certain structural complexity. Topics can involve popular science, society, culture, education, technology, public policy, etc., but need to provide clear context for complex sentences rather than scattered, isolated sentence piling.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment: Question types should be single-choice questions or short-answer questions. Question language often appears as \"understand/grasp the meaning of a certain sentence,\" \"analyze the logical relationship/meaning/attitude of a certain sentence,\" \"which of the following understandings of a certain sentence is incorrect,\" \"explain the meaning of a certain sentence in your own words,\" etc. If questions require students to engage in oral communication, write essays, draft planning documents, etc., or only do grammatical terminology fill-in-the-blank or component marking without implementing sentence meaning inference and reading comprehension, this does not conform to this dimension.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: High-alignment questions typically require examinees to complete the ability chain of \"locating the question sentence in the original text → dividing or clarifying clauses and modifiers → grasping logical relationships and references in context → paraphrasing, summarizing, or judging in their own language,\" reflecting the process of moving from language form to meaning understanding in Chinese language. If questions mainly assess recitation-type knowledge, background common sense, or theory unrelated to the text, with low requirements for sentence meaning and logic analysis, alignment is low.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: If questions involve sentence components, conjunctions, pronoun reference, rhetorical devices, and other Chinese language knowledge, these should serve to help students understand sentence meaning, clarify information hierarchy, and judge attitudes, rather than treating this knowledge itself as isolated test points. If answer scoring mainly relies on terminology listing without examining sentence meaning grasp, this does not conform to the ability orientation of this dimension.\n\n6. Task Level and \"Four-Wing\" Alignment: Questions with higher alignment generally have progression at \"understanding-analysis-summarization/evaluation\" levels, both assessing accurate understanding of complex sentence basic content and requiring contextual comprehensive inference and brief expression, reflecting certain comprehensiveness and applied nature without excessively elevating to professional research-level abstruse interpretation, nor flowing to mere surface mechanical memorization.\n\n7. Negative Signals: If the following situations occur, alignment evaluation for this dimension should be significantly lowered: departing from specific context, only analyzing grammatical terminology or mechanical error correction on isolated sentences; piecing together hollow slogan-style or logically incoherent \"long sentences\" for question-making; heavy use of obscure terminology making sentence meaning impossible to infer from text, turning the task into pure professional translation; or only having students do structural marking on scattered sentences with almost no connection to overall reading comprehension tasks.\n\nPlease synthesize the above points to give a level evaluation of the given question on this dimension (such as: Highly Aligned / Basically Aligned / Partially Related / Significantly Deviated), and briefly explain reasons in 2-4 sentences, citing key information from question stems, materials, or reference answers as much as possible to support your judgment."

Orientation Alignment: Check whether the main focus of materials, question stems, and reference answers concentrates on understanding and analyzing the function of certain key sentences (such as underlined sentences, title sentences, opening/closing sentences, transitional sentences, topic sentences, etc.), whether examinees are required to explain the function of these sentences at structural, content, or emotional/argumentation levels. If only general content understanding, paragraph summarization, or only assessing memorization-type knowledge (such as simply identifying rhetorical names or grammatical terminology), alignment with this dimension is low.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Whether question materials belong to argumentative or expository texts (including argumentative essays, political-theoretical expository texts, popular science expository texts, etc.), and whether texts actually contain key sentences that can govern the full text, link preceding and following content, point out the center, echo previous text, or concentratedly express viewpoints and emotions. Whether question stems contain or actually point to problem domains such as \"function,\" \"purpose,\" \"meaning,\" \"significance,\" \"expressive effect,\" \"analyze underlined sentence in context,\" \"echo between preceding and following,\" \"link preceding and following,\" \"point out the center,\" \"govern the full text,\" and whether this information points to reading comprehension tasks rather than writing tasks.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment: Whether questions mainly use single-choice questions and short-answer questions, whether question methods are suitable for presenting key sentence function assessment through reading comprehension and written expression; if involving writing or expression contexts, whether the core is still structure analysis and transfer application containing reading materials, without evolving into complete essay writing, oral discussion, or other interactive tasks. If questions require students to write speeches, planning documents, etc., with key sentence analysis only as background prompts, alignment is limited.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: Whether the core of assessment is information extraction, understanding interpretation, structure analysis, and appreciation evaluation among key Chinese language abilities. High-alignment questions typically require examinees to find relevant sentences or paragraphs within specified ranges, explain the meaning of key sentences in context, and analyze their functions from structural and content/emotional/argumentation dimensions; if questions mainly require recitation, recognition of certain concepts, or simply judging right or wrong without requiring contextual analysis of key sentences, this does not conform to the ability requirements of this dimension.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: If involving Chinese language knowledge such as general-specific relationships, parallel relationships, progression relationships, comparison, cause-effect, transition, echo, transition, rhetorical methods, etc., these should serve understanding and analyzing the function of key sentences rather than being assessed in isolation. If questions only ask \"what rhetoric is used\" or \"what sentence pattern is this\" without further requiring explanation of their role in the full text, knowledge elements are not serving the ability assessment of this dimension.\n\n6. Task Level and Comprehensiveness: Whether questions reflect reasonable gradients from basic understanding to analytical evaluation, for example: first identifying key sentences, then explaining sentence meaning, finally analyzing their role in full-text structure and viewpoint expression, with appropriate evaluation guidance when necessary.

Orientation Alignment\nExamine question stems and reference answers to determine whether the main task requires examinees to convert between different information formats, such as mutual conversion between text explanations and charts, flowcharts, table columns, key point summaries; whether emphasis is on screening, integrating, and organized expression of key information; if mainly only content understanding, emotional attitude judgment, or viewpoint evaluation with almost no format conversion involved, alignment is low.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment\nCheck whether materials are argumentative, expository, or practical texts and their accompanying statistical charts, relationship diagrams, flowcharts, multi-text graphic materials, whether topics relate to information presentation and use in real life and learning contexts. If materials are purely literary texts without charts or flowchart information, or chart content is fabricated and false lacking reasonable context, alignment evaluation should be lowered.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment\nConfirm whether question types are single-choice questions or short-answer questions, and both are one-time paper-based reading comprehension and written expression tasks. Whether questions guide information format conversion with prompts like \"according to the chart,\" \"read graphic materials,\" \"summarize in no more than X characters,\" \"complete flowchart,\" \"organize text into key points/table format expression\"; if questions appear as oral communication, speech planning, writing topics, or interactive tasks, this should be judged as not conforming to this dimension's requirements.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment\nWhether the core of assessment is extracting, screening, comparing, and integrating information from materials and clearly presenting in specified formats, rather than purely assessing a certain background knowledge point, concept definition, or mathematical calculation. Pay attention to whether questions prompt examinees to clarify material structure, grasp key points, and reflect organization and summarization in expression—these are closely related to subject literacy and key abilities corresponding to this dimension.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree\nIf questions involve genre features, chart interpretation methods, sentence simplification, connector use, and other Chinese language knowledge, need to judge whether this knowledge serves the information conversion task itself, such as helping understand chart meaning, organize logical sequence, compress information, rather than being assessed in isolation. If knowledge assessment has no obvious connection to information conversion, alignment is lowered.\n\n6. Task Level and Comprehensiveness\nAnalyze task requirement levels: whether only extracting several words or sentences from materials, or requiring summarization, integration, and reorganization within limited word counts, or comparing and merging among multiple materials. Tasks that can comprehensively assess screening, integration, and expression at medium-high levels are more aligned with this dimension's expectations; if only staying at mechanical copying or simple correspondence, alignment is low.\n\n7. Negative Signals\nFocus on checking whether the following situations occur: only requiring mechanical copying of data or low-level rewriting of original sentences; chart or flowchart content is false and lacking reasonable context; questions completely depart from materials, vaguely discussing the significance of information conversion; questions appearing unrelated to Chinese language reading and expression abilities as pure calculation or pure memorization type questions. Once the above situations exist, alignment evaluation for this dimension should be significantly lowered.\n\nWhen completing evaluation, please synthesize the above points to give an overall judgment for the question: can use levels like \"Highly Aligned / Basically Aligned / Partially Related / Significantly Deviated,\" and briefly explain reasons in 2-4 sentences, citing key information from question stem requirements, material presentation methods, and reference answer features as much as possible to support your judgment."

Orientation Alignment: Check whether the main thinking tasks of question stems and reference answers focus on \"viewpoint-material\" correspondence and support relationships, such as judging whether certain materials can prove certain viewpoints, whether arguments are appropriate and strong, whether examples are fitting, whether evidence is sufficient, explaining the role of certain materials in argumentation, selecting materials that best support certain viewpoints, pointing out inappropriate arguments and reasons, etc., rather than mainly assessing general information summarization, word and sentence understanding, rhetorical appreciation, or value expression unrelated to the text.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Whether materials are argumentative or expository texts (including commentary, current affairs review, policy interpretation, popular science explanation, survey reports, multi-material combinations, etc.), whether they simultaneously present relatively clear viewpoints and corresponding factual materials, cases, data, or charts in structure, whether questions truly utilize these elements rather than only staying at background information.\n\n3.

Orientation Alignment\nWhether the center of assessment is: through reading texts and analyzing language materials, summarizing methods, strategies, steps, procedures for doing things or learning therein, or language use patterns and expression requirements, and requiring examinees to summarize, explain, and apply in their own words; if mainly only understanding general content, summarizing viewpoints, analyzing argumentation, appreciating values, with almost no involvement of method and language pattern extraction and transfer, alignment is low.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment\nWhether materials are argumentative or expository texts, or language examples and cases with clear explanation or argumentative coloring; whether topics are close to learning methods, practical steps, action strategies, writing or reading techniques, language use examples, expression rules, language phenomenon analysis, etc. If materials are only related to life common sense or abstract principles and not conducive to extracting operational methods or language patterns, this is not conducive to reflecting this dimension.\n\n3.

Ability Component Alignment\nWhether questions reflect the ability chain from information screening → comparative induction → abstract methods or patterns → transfer to new contexts → solve specific problems or language problems, rather than only assessing isolated Chinese language knowledge points. Pay attention to whether assessment requires examinees to explain \"why do it this way,\" \"what is the basis,\" \"how to adjust methods or expression in what contexts\" in combination with textual language phenomena.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree\nKnowledge involved (such as genre features, explanation methods, argumentation methods, rhetoric, register style, grammatical structure, etc.) should serve extracting and applying methods and language patterns, helping students make judgments and applications in new contexts, rather than being assessed for testing purposes divorced from specific tasks.\n\n6.

Context and Material Alignment: Whether materials are argumentative or expository texts, whether presentation methods align with contexts like \"discovering problems, posing questions, problem awareness, inquiry awareness, special topic inquiry, research topics, survey research, comparative research, research reports, inquiry plans,\" such as special topic learning and inquiry cases around language phenomena or text content, learning task explanations where students pose problems on reading texts and design research paths, learning notes or classroom records organizing language use patterns, material sets of multiple materials around the same social or cultural phenomenon, practical cases of language and culture surveys and comparative research, task explanations for language and culture survey reports or special topic research reports, etc.; if materials are completely unrelated to the above contexts, alignment evaluation should be lowered.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment: Whether questions adopt single-choice questions and short-answer question formats, whether tasks are one-time paper-based reading comprehension and written expression rather than oral communication, interview design, complete writing, and other activities; whether questions require students to pose problems, draft topics, or conceive inquiry plans rather than only making simple choices or restatements.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: Whether assessment processes prompt students to close read texts, use material information to discover doubts, contradictions, gaps, or phenomena worthy of deep thinking, then form clear, specific, inquirable problems and express inquiry approaches in organized language, rather than asking questions randomly based on life common sense or only memorizing ready-made conclusions.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: If involving text genre, argumentation methods, rhetoric, cultural allusions, and other Chinese language knowledge, whether this serves the task of \"discovering and posing problems, designing inquiry,\" such as defining research objects, determining comparison dimensions, selecting data sources, rather than treating knowledge memorization itself as assessment focus.\n\n6. Task Level and \"Four-Wing\" Alignment: Comprehensively judge whether questions guide students beyond basic understanding to conduct inquiry activity design with certain comprehensiveness, practicality, and openness, neither too vague and abstract nor too complex to implement, roughly consistent with this dimension's cultivation requirements for subject literacy and key abilities.\n\n7. Negative Signals: If questions mainly have students depart from texts to vaguely discuss implications and significance, or only present fixed research problems mechanically requiring students to copy procedures, or only assess scattered knowledge points lacking real inquiry contexts, or materials are clearly slogan-ized with conclusions preset and lacking facts and thinking process demonstration, alignment with this dimension should be considered low.\n\nPlease synthesize the above points to give an alignment level for the question on the \"Problem Posing and Inquiry\" dimension, such as \"Highly Aligned,\" \"Basically Aligned,\" \"Partially Related,\" \"Significantly Deviated,\" and briefly explain reasons in 2-4 sentences, citing key information from question stems, materials, or reference answers as much as possible to support your judgment."

Orientation Alignment: Check whether the main direction of all questions and reference answers requires examinees to conduct information screening, inductive classification, and organized presentation on the basis of text understanding, whether focusing on \"Structured Organization and Outline Generation,\" rather than mainly concentrating on word and sentence understanding, single viewpoint evaluation, and other ability dimensions.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Whether question materials are argumentative or expository texts (can be multi-text or data packages), whether topics are suitable for information integration and structured organization, such as multi-text information integration reading, multiple short texts on the same theme, explanatory/argumentative materials containing tables and diagrams, texts displaying learning notes or mind maps, etc.; if materials are only abstract symbols or graphics lacking language material support, alignment is lowered.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment: Whether questions adopt four-choice single-selection questions and short-answer question formats, whether questions point to tasks like \"organize materials, integrate information, extract key points, list outlines, hierarchical summarization, relationship diagrams,\" whether avoiding oral communication, speeches, writing topics, and other task formats unrelated to this reading dimension.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: Whether assessment activities implement key Chinese language abilities such as information screening, inductive classification, and structured construction, rather than only requiring remembering certain definitions, concept names, or isolated conclusions; whether prompting examinees to construct concept networks or outline structures in Chinese language practice contexts.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: If involving genre, argumentation methods, chart reading, and other Chinese language knowledge, these should clearly serve tasks of organizing materials, clarifying structural hierarchy and key points, rather than treating knowledge points as independent test points divorced from structured organization.\n\n6. Task Level and \"Four-Wing\" Alignment: Whether overall task difficulty reflects progression from basic key point extraction to higher-level multi-text integration and structure optimization, whether conducive to enhancing comprehensiveness, applied nature, and inquiry nature, rather than staying at scattered memorization level.\n\n7. Negative Signals: If questions appear as pure logical reasoning questions departing from specific texts giving only abstract concept terms for students to mechanically connect, only testing graphic memorization or chart details lacking language material support, only making \"outlines\" on isolated sentences or vague themes, or overall context seriously divorced from students' Chinese language learning experience and real life, this should be considered clearly deviating from this dimension with significantly lowered alignment evaluation.\n\nPlease synthesize the above points to make alignment judgment for the given question on this dimension, giving levels like \"Highly Aligned,\" \"Basically Aligned,\" \"Partially Related,\" \"Significantly Deviated,\" and summarize reasons in 2-4 sentences, combining question stem questions, material presentation methods, and key information in reference answers as much as possible."

Orientation Alignment: Observe question stems and reference answers to see whether focus is on \"defining or explaining a certain concept/term,\" \"judging correctness and appropriateness of concept usage,\" \"comparing whether different expressions are consistent or have concept confusion,\" rather than mainly shifting to other abilities (such as pure structure organization, pure emotional attitude evaluation, etc.).\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Whether materials are argumentative or expository texts, whether they contain concept definition paragraphs, terminology definitions and usage, key formulations in policy or academic texts, language standardization cases, examples of understanding or decision deviation due to concept confusion, etc., aligning with the \"Concept Definition and Consistent Usage\" characteristics of this dimension.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment: Whether questions mainly use choice questions and short-answer questions, requiring examinees to complete definition, judgment, comparison, and other tasks through reading comprehension and written expression, avoiding designing speeches, debates, planning, and other interactive or oral tasks, nor being standalone writing topics.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: Whether questions guide examinees to summarize concept usage patterns on the basis of organizing language materials, analyze whether expressions are accurate and appropriate, and support viewpoints with standardized and rigorous language, rather than only assessing rote memorization of textbook or dictionary definitions, or scattered knowledge points unrelated to concepts.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: When involving genre, logical relationships, rhetoric, argumentation methods, and other knowledge, whether these serve understanding and judging concept definition and usage consistency, rather than being isolated into pure knowledge test points.\n\n6. Task Level and \"Four-Wing\" Alignment: Whether overall tasks reflect progression from memorization and understanding to analysis and evaluation, both with basic concept identification and certain comprehensive application and judgment, reflecting cultivation of key Chinese language abilities, rather than staying at requirements only circling concept terms at low levels.\n\n7. Negative Signals: Once questions mainly rely on dictionary-style definitions to answer departing from specific text context and completely unnecessary to return to context; or heavily repeat textbook or dictionary entries; or list large amounts of abstract terminology or slogans lacking language use comparison and judgment contexts; or adopt oral communication, situational performance, and other task formats unrelated to reading comprehension, this should be considered clearly not conforming to this dimension's question requirements with significantly lowered alignment evaluation.\n\nPlease make a judgment on the alignment of the given question on the \"Concept Definition and Consistent Usage\" dimension based on the above points, giving levels like \"Highly Aligned / Basically Aligned / Partially Related / Significantly Deviated,\" and briefly explain reasons in 2-4 sentences combining key information from question stems, materials, and reference answers."

Orientation Alignment: Check whether the main focus of question stems and reference answers concentrates on explaining cultural phenomena, customs and concepts, value orientations involved in texts and their ancient-modern (Chinese-foreign) differences, whether examinees are required to analyze and evaluate in comparisons, rather than mainly shifting to general information screening, sentence understanding, and other abilities weakly related to this dimension.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Whether question materials are argumentative or expository texts, or presented in multi-article argumentative or expository material group format, whether topics focus on cultural context, historical context, customs and etiquette, traditional concepts, cultural connotation, Chinese-foreign cultural differences, value concept changes, cultural inheritance and transformation, and other content, rather than pure story-like narrative or materials with extremely weak connection to cultural context.\n\n3. Question Type and Task Format Alignment: Whether questions mainly use single-choice questions and short-answer questions, whether belonging to one-time paper-based reading comprehension and written expression tasks rather than speeches, debates, planning, and other interactive or oral tasks, nor writing essays or practical writing templates; whether choice questions are used for identifying cultural information, judging whether interpretations are appropriate, whether short-answer questions are used for itemized explanation, comparison, and evaluation.\n\n4. Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: Whether key assessment steps include extracting information related to cultural context from texts, interpreting in combination with era background and cultural common sense, conducting comparative analysis and rational evaluation in ancient-modern or Chinese-foreign multi-text comparisons, rather than only having students recite cultural common sense, list historical facts, or make simple stance statements.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: If involving genre, argumentation methods, rhetoric, cultural allusions, and other Chinese language knowledge, whether this is to better explain cultural concepts, value orientations, and ancient-modern perspective differences carried by texts rather than treating these knowledge as isolated test points divorced from cultural context interpretation.\n\n6. Task Level and \"Four-Wing\" Alignment: Whether questions reflect level requirements of comparison, analysis, and evaluation beyond basic understanding, with certain comprehensiveness and critical thinking, guiding students to think in open perspectives of absorbing advanced culture and inheriting excellent traditional culture, rather than staying at simple identification or denial of cultural labels.\n\n7. Negative Signals: Focus on checking whether the following situations exist: materials stay at slogan-style, promotional \"cultural interpretation\"; questions only give abstract cultural viewpoints lacking specific text support; answering mainly relies on obscure cultural common sense with difficulty obtaining information from texts; questions only have students vaguely \"discuss significance/implications\" or \"discuss ancient-modern differences,\" or only make simple merit judgment or binary choice statements among different viewpoints without requiring comparative analysis based on textual evidence.

Orientation Alignment: Examine core tasks of question stems and reference answers to see whether examinees are required to make judgments, comparisons, or modifications on word usage and collocation usage, commendatory/derogatory and register coloring, semantic weight, logical relationships in text passages on the basis of understanding argumentative or expository texts, rather than mainly assessing information summarization, viewpoint evaluation, writing techniques, and other abilities.\n\n2. Context and Material Alignment: Check whether materials are argumentative or expository texts and related passages, whether relatively complete and authentic language contexts are provided; whether passages related to word usage, idioms, fixed collocations, and conjunctions appear in texts, such as keyword selection and replacement, inappropriate word usage examples, sentence groups reflecting cause-effect, transition, progression, or parallel relationships, rather than context-free vocabulary lists or sentence-making materials seriously divorced from actual language life.\n\n3.

Subject Literacy and Ability Alignment: Analyze whether questions prompt examinees to comprehensively apply Chinese language abilities such as semantic understanding, emotional coloring judgment, register style grasp, and logical relationship analysis in context, rather than only requiring memorizing idiom definitions, grammatical terminology, or isolated collocation rules; see whether conducive to enhancing students' conscious awareness of language standardization and appropriateness.\n\n5. Knowledge Element Service Degree: Examine whether Chinese language knowledge involved (such as idiom meanings, fixed collocation habits, logical functions of conjunctions, etc.) serves actual expression problems in context, whether tightly combined with question stem requirements, rather than testing knowledge for knowledge's sake.\n\n6.
